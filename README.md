# liri-node-app
This is a coding bootcamp assignment to create LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

The possible commands to take in are <spotify-this-song>, <concert-this>, <movie-this>, and <do-what-it-says>.  A value can be added after each command (excluding do-what-it-says), and the application will search either the spotify api, bandsintown, or OMDB depending on the respective command.  <do-what-it-says> will read a local test file that has one of these commands already written on it, and run the command using node file system.
